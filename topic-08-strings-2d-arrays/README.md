# Topic 08: Strings and 2D Arrays

## Overview

In this topic, you will learn advanced string manipulation and how to work with two-dimensional arrays. These concepts are essential for text processing and working with grid-based data.

## What You Will Learn

- String operations: length, concatenation, comparison
- String methods: find, substr, at
- Character-by-character processing
- 2D array declaration and initialization
- Row and column traversal
- Common patterns for grids and tables

## Key Concepts at a Glance

### Strings
| Operation | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Length | `str.length()` |
| Access char | `str[0]` or `str.at(0)` |
| Find | `str.find("hello")` |
| Substring | `str.substr(0, 5)` |

### 2D Arrays
| Concept | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Declaration | `int grid[3][4];` |
| Access | `grid[row][col]` |
| Traverse | Nested for loops |
