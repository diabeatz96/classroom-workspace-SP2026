# CSC 126: Introduction to Computer Science

**College of Staten Island (CUNY)**
**Spring 2026**
**Instructor:** Adam Kostandy

## Course Overview

Welcome to CSC 126! This is your first programming course, and we will be using C++ to learn fundamental computer science concepts. No prior programming experience is required - we start from the very beginning.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Write programs that solve real-world problems
- Understand how to break down complex problems into smaller steps
- Use variables, loops, functions, and arrays effectively
- Debug and test your own code
- Think like a programmer

## Repository Organization

This repository is organized by **topic**, not by week. Each topic folder contains everything you need to learn that concept:

| Folder | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [getting-started](getting-started/) | Setup | Environment setup and your first program |
| [topic-01-output](topic-01-output/) | Output | Displaying text with cout |
| [topic-02-variables-input](topic-02-variables-input/) | Variables & Input | Storing data and reading user input |
| [topic-03-arithmetic-expressions](topic-03-arithmetic-expressions/) | Arithmetic | Math operations and expressions |
| [topic-04-selection](topic-04-selection/) | Selection | Making decisions with if/else |
| [topic-05-loops](topic-05-loops/) | Loops | Repeating actions |
| [topic-06-functions](topic-06-functions/) | Functions | Organizing code into reusable pieces |
| [topic-07-arrays](topic-07-arrays/) | Arrays | Storing collections of data |
| [topic-08-strings-2d-arrays](topic-08-strings-2d-arrays/) | Strings & 2D Arrays | Text processing and grids |
| [topic-09-searching-sorting](topic-09-searching-sorting/) | Searching & Sorting | Finding and organizing data |

### Special Topics

| Folder | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| [topic-10-raylib](topic-10-raylib/) | Raylib (Graphics) | Creating graphical desktop applications |
| [topic-11-file-io](topic-11-file-io/) | File I/O | Reading and writing files in C++ |

See [SCHEDULE.md](SCHEDULE.md) for the week-by-week calendar.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment** - Follow the guide for your operating system in [getting-started](getting-started/)
2. **Review the schedule** - Check [SCHEDULE.md](SCHEDULE.md) to see what topic we are covering this week
3. **Work through the topic materials** in order:
   - Read the lesson
   - Study the worked examples
   - Try the Parsons problems
   - Complete the fill-in-the-blank exercises
   - Solve the practice problems
   - Build the mini-project

## Tools We Use

- **IDE Options:** Visual Studio Community (Windows), VS Code (any platform), Xcode (Mac), or Replit (browser-based)
- **Compiler:** Any C++17 compatible compiler (Visual Studio, g++, clang++)
- **Textbook:** Available through Pearson (console.pearson.com)

**New to running C++ programs?** See [RUNNING-CPP-FILES.md](RUNNING-CPP-FILES.md) for step-by-step instructions for each IDE.

## Resources

- [Common Errors Guide](resources/common-errors.md) - Solutions to frequent mistakes
- [Debugging Guide](resources/debugging-guide.md) - How to find and fix bugs
- [Style Guide](resources/style-guide.md) - Code formatting standards

## Getting Help

- Office hours: See syllabus for times and location
- Email: See syllabus for contact information
- Study groups: Encouraged! Learning together helps everyone.

## Academic Integrity

All code you submit must be your own work. You may discuss concepts with classmates, but you must write your own code. See the syllabus for the full academic integrity policy.

Good luck this semester! Programming is a skill that improves with practice. The more you code, the better you will get.
