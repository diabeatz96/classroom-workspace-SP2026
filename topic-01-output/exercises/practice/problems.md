## Submission Guidelines

For each problem:
1. Create a new file named `prob1.cpp`, `prob2.cpp`, etc.
2. Include a comment header with your name and the problem number
3. Compile and run to verify your output matches exactly
4. Check that your code follows the style guide

## Self-Check Questions

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] Does my program compile without errors?
- [ ] Does my output match the expected output exactly?
- [ ] Did I use the required techniques (tabs, escape sequences, etc.)?
- [ ] Is my code properly indented and formatted?
- [ ] Did I include comments where helpful?
