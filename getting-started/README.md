# Getting Started

Welcome to CSC 126! Before you can start programming, you need to set up your development environment. Choose the setup guide that matches your situation:

## Setup Guides

| Guide | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| [setup-windows.md](setup-windows.md) | Windows users (Visual Studio Community recommended) |
| [setup-mac.md](setup-mac.md) | Mac users (Xcode or VS Code) |
| [setup-replit.md](setup-replit.md) | Anyone who wants to code in a browser (no installation required) |

## Which Option Should I Choose?

**If you have a Windows computer:** Use Visual Studio Community. It is free, powerful, and widely used in industry.

**If you have a Mac:** Use Xcode (free from the App Store) or VS Code with the C++ extension.

**If you have a Chromebook or prefer not to install software:** Use Replit. It works entirely in your browser.

**If you are unsure:** Start with Replit to get coding quickly, then set up a local environment later.

## After Setup

Once your environment is ready, work through the [first-program](first-program/) folder to write and run your first C++ program. This will verify that everything is working correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you run into problems during setup:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in your setup guide
2. Search the error message online
3. Ask during office hours or in class
4. Email the instructor with a screenshot of the error

Do not spend hours stuck on a setup issue - ask for help!
