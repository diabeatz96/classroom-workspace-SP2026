# Topic 03: Arithmetic and Expressions

## Overview

In this topic, you will learn how to perform mathematical calculations in C++. From simple addition to complex expressions, these skills are essential for building any program that works with numbers.

## What You Will Learn

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Operator precedence (order of operations)
- Integer vs. floating-point division
- Type casting
- Compound assignment operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`
- Increment and decrement: `++`, `--`

## Key Concepts at a Glance

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `+` | Addition | `5 + 3` = 8 |
| `-` | Subtraction | `5 - 3` = 2 |
| `*` | Multiplication | `5 * 3` = 15 |
| `/` | Division | `5.0 / 2` = 2.5 |
| `%` | Modulo (remainder) | `5 % 3` = 2 |
