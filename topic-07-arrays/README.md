# Topic 07: Arrays

## Overview

In this topic, you will learn how to store and work with collections of data using arrays. Arrays let you manage multiple related values under a single name.

## What You Will Learn

- Array declaration and initialization
- Accessing elements with indices
- Traversing arrays with loops
- Parallel arrays
- Passing arrays to functions
- Common array operations (sum, average, min, max)

## Materials

### Lesson
- [LESSON.md](lesson/LESSON.md) - Main instructional content
- [examples/](lesson/examples/) - Standalone example programs

### Exercises (Complete in Order)

1. **[Worked Examples](exercises/worked-examples/)** - Study complete solutions with explanations
2. **[Parsons Problems](exercises/parsons-problems/)** - Arrange scrambled code into correct order
3. **[Completion Problems](exercises/completion/)** - Fill in the blanks in partial code
4. **[Practice Problems](exercises/practice/)** - Write programs from scratch

### Mini-Project
- [Grade Tracker](mini-project/PROJECT.md) - Track and analyze student grades

## Key Concepts at a Glance

| Concept | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Declaration | `int scores[5];` |
| Initialization | `int nums[3] = {1, 2, 3};` |
| Access element | `scores[0] = 95;` |
| Array size | Use a constant: `const int SIZE = 5;` |
| Traverse | `for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)` |
