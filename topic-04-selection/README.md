# Topic 04: Selection Structures

## Overview

In this topic, you will learn how to make decisions in your programs. Selection structures allow your code to take different paths based on conditions, making programs dynamic and responsive to different inputs.

## What You Will Learn

- Relational operators: `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- `if` statements
- `if-else` statements
- Nested `if` statements
- `switch` statements
- Common patterns for decision making
