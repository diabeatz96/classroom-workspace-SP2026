# Topic 09: Searching, Sorting, and Extraction

## Overview

In this final topic, you will learn fundamental algorithms for searching and sorting data. These algorithms are the foundation of computer science and are used everywhere in software development.

## What You Will Learn

- Linear (sequential) search
- Binary search
- Selection sort
- Bubble sort
- Extracting and filtering data from arrays
- Algorithm efficiency basics

## Materials

### Lesson
- [LESSON.md](lesson/LESSON.md) - Main instructional content
- [examples/](lesson/examples/) - Standalone example programs

### Exercises (Complete in Order)

1. **[Worked Examples](exercises/worked-examples/)** - Study complete solutions with explanations
2. **[Parsons Problems](exercises/parsons-problems/)** - Arrange scrambled code into correct order
3. **[Completion Problems](exercises/completion/)** - Fill in the blanks in partial code
4. **[Practice Problems](exercises/practice/)** - Write programs from scratch

### Mini-Project
- [Student Roster Manager](mini-project/PROJECT.md) - Manage and analyze student data

## Key Concepts at a Glance

| Algorithm | Use Case | Speed |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Linear Search | Find item in unsorted list | Slower (O(n)) |
| Binary Search | Find item in sorted list | Faster (O(log n)) |
| Selection Sort | Sort small datasets | Simple but slow |
| Bubble Sort | Sort small datasets | Simple but slow |
