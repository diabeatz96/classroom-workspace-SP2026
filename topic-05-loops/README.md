# Topic 05: Repetition Structures (Loops)

## Overview

In this topic, you will learn how to repeat actions in your programs. Loops are essential for processing collections of data, validating input, and automating repetitive tasks.

## What You Will Learn

- `while` loops for condition-based repetition
- `do-while` loops for guaranteed first execution
- `for` loops for counting iterations
- Nested loops
- Loop control: `break` and `continue`
- Counters and accumulators
- Common loop patterns

## Key Concepts at a Glance

| Loop Type | Use When |
|-----------|----------|
| `while` | Repeat while condition is true |
| `do-while` | Run at least once, then repeat while true |
| `for` | Repeat a specific number of times |
