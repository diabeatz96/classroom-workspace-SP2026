# Topic 02: Variables and Input

## Overview

In this topic, you will learn how to store data in variables and get input from users. Variables are the building blocks of every program - they let you remember and work with information.

## What You Will Learn

- Data types: `int`, `double`, `char`, `bool`, and `string`
- Declaring and initializing variables
- Reading user input with `cin`
- Assignment and reassignment
- Naming conventions for variables
